# Fundamentals of SQL

This folder is intended to store most of my re-studies of SQL using PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4). All files are saved as .sql extensions, in a way that they can be ran in any SQL DBMS.

PostgreSQL's file extensions are not .sql, but in this way, Github aknowledges the syntax, comments in-code and can highlight some commands to make it more readable.
