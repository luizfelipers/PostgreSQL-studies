# PostgreSQL-studies

This repo is intended to be the second step towards the objectives listed on https://github.com/luizfelipers/DB-SQL-restudies , and a continuation to the SQL studies I was into.
For this task, the DBMS that's going to be used will be PostgreSQL, and the subjects covered will be similar to my SQL-Restudies repo (linked above), but trying to reach further topics like Object-Relational Mapping and Complex Data Types. The next step of this journey will be learning about NoSQL, primarily using MongoDB.


PS: I apologize for the inconsistency of the commenting language. Sometimes I comment in English, sometimes in Portuguese.
